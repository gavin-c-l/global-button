They exist for one of three reasons: Learning a new technology, I thought it would be funny, or I was bored</p>

            <p class="text-center mt-15 md:mx-15 lg:mx-30 text-lg md:text-2xl sour-gummy px-2 md:px-0"><a class="link-hover" href="./applets/global-counter/global-counter.html">Global Counter:</a> 2 buttons. One makes the number go up. The other makes the number go down. This applies to everyone and it's fun to see how people change it. When showing this to friends, some changed it to funny numbers or pep songs, and it gets silly when multiple people are pressing the buttons at the same time. This was the result of me trying to figure out the very basics of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/firebase/firebase-realtime-database/" class="link-hover">Firebase Realtime Database,</a> which will be feature more across this website.</p>
            <p class="text-center mt-15 md:mx-15 lg:mx-30 text-lg md:text-2xl sour-gummy px-2 md:px-0"><a class="link-hover" href="./applets/color-picker/index.html">Color Clicker:</a> A simple game where the goal is to find all the colors by clicking on the screen. I made this right before the fall 2024 semester to brush up on my javascript skills. I used the <a href="https://chir.ag/projects/ntc/" class="link-hover">Name That Color Javascript</a> file to get all the color names and it is really interesting to see them all. Even when using an autoclicker and leaving it running, I have only gotten to around 1350/1566, so good luck!</p>
